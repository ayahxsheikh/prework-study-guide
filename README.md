## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

My motivation for this project was to challenge myself and learn the basics of front-end-development.
I built the project to track the progress i make as i learn content as a student in the bootcamp and to review of what i have covered so far.

I learned how to use git commands and how to sync Github repo with current work. 
I also learned how to use functions and variables to enable basic JavaScript.
